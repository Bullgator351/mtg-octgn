--------

3.0.0
-Major update release to coincide with the new OCTGN development team's first major release

Game Functions:
-Double-clicking a card in the Library, Graveyard, or Exiled Zone will now cast that card (similar to hand), and any CAST autoscript tags will be triggered
-All double-faced cards use the new "alternate image" features in OCTGN to "flip" the cards, instead of swapping between tokens
-All functionality involving the transform cards swapping between tokens is removed
-Morph/Transform function has been redesigned
-Cascade functionality implemented (may be buggy)
-Using the "Attach card" action on a card without a target will remove it from the attachcards list (effectively "unattaches" a card)
-Added "Pick a random card" action (CTRL+R shortcut) for the Graveyard and Exiled Zone, which will publically display the name of a random card in that group (for abilities like the Innistrad "random card from the graveyard" cards)

Autoscripts:
-Autoscript recognition system has been overhauled, new bugs may have been created
-the autoscript processing script now breaks each tag up into parts and processes each part individually (so tags like destroy.token[somwurm1, 1].token[somwurm2, 1]; will now work)
-Complete overhaul in the method in which card tags are extracted
-M10, ARB, CON added to autoscript tags
-All token-generating autoscript tags rely on the "marker/tokens" set definition instead of the tokens found in their originating sets.

Auto-Align:
-Auto-Align script will update the cattach dictionary if either part of a card/attachment pair has left the table
-the MOVETO autoscript will run now recognizes TABLE and STACK destinations.  STACK will trigger any CAST autoscript tags, and TABLE will trigger ETB autoscript tags.
-moveto[graveyard] autoscript now triggers DESTROY autoscript tags.
-Card alignment no longer asks if the player is on the inverted side of the table (now automatic).
-Cleaned up auto-align to support the new "move to back" python function

Misc.:
-Auras will check for a target as they're cast, then automatically attach themselves to the target when it resolves
-if the target leaves the table, the aura will be countered (sent to graveyard) 
-Fixed bug where the card name wasn't hoverable in the resolve script's chat log message
-The "Tags" card property has been removed from the deck editor
